Git and Github are two diffrent things;
2 types of dependencies-
1.Dev dependency
dev dependency are used in development phase.
2.Normal dependency
normal dependencies are also used in production.

when we install any dependency into our project it can have its own dependencies which are also installed along with it and those dependencies might also have their on dependencies and so on...this is known as transitive dependency


config driven ui ep 4 1:12-1:21


each element should be uniquely identified when we are mapping through data so that react doesnt have to rerender everthing when
a new element enters. We put that unique identifier in "key". We genrally use an ID given in the data. React official
documentation says not to use Index as the id as key. In worst case scenario if we dont have unique id in the data we got
we can use index but it is bad practice. understand from below :

not using key(not acceptable) <<<< using index as key (bad practice) <<<<<<< using unique id(best practice)
 

State variable: whenever a state variable updates, 
react re-renders this component(reconciliation cycle is triggered)


Seperation of concerns OR Single responsibility principle : 

when we make different project for each and every microservice required(for example backend, ui, authentication, DB, Sms sending, etc).
Each and every service has its own job.

never create state variables in a condition(if/else)

#React hooks: 
useState()
useEffect()

# 2 types of Routing in Web Apps
1.Client Side Rounting - In this the data is already sent to the client and it only needs to be rendered. This is the logic behind single page apps
2.Server Side Routing - Makes a network call to the server and fetches data then the page is rendered
